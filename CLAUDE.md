# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Development Commands

**Package Manager**: Uses `pnpm` (specified via `packageManager` in package.json)

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development build with watch mode
pnpm run watch

# Production build (for packaging)
pnpm run package

# Type checking only
pnpm run check-types

# Linting and formatting
pnpm run lint          # Full lint check (biome + knip + types) 

# Testing
pnpm run test          # Run VS Code extension tests
pnpm run pretest       # Compile tests and fixtures

# Publishing
pnpm run vsce:package  # Create .vsix package
pnpm run vsce:publish  # Publish to marketplace
```

### Key Build Scripts
- `compile`: Type check + lint + esbuild (development)
- `package`: Type check + lint + esbuild (production, minified)
- `watch`: Parallel watch for both esbuild and TypeScript

## Architecture Overview

This is a VS Code extension that provides automatic Angular imports and intelligent completions for Angular templates.

### Core Components

**Extension Entry Point** (`src/extension.ts`)
- Multi-project workspace support with automatic Angular project detection
- Project-specific indexer instances managed via Maps
- Periodic reindexing with configurable intervals
- Configuration-driven activation and cleanup

**Angular Indexer** (`src/services/indexer.ts`)
- Uses `ts-morph` for TypeScript AST parsing
- Trie-based selector storage for efficient prefix matching
- Supports both local project files and node_modules libraries
- Caches parsed data in VS Code workspace state
- File system watcher for incremental updates

**Provider Architecture** (`src/providers/`)
- `completion.ts`: IntelliSense for Angular selectors in templates
- `diagnostics.ts`: Highlights missing imports with configurable severity
- `quickfix.ts`: Code actions to auto-import Angular elements

**Type System** (`src/types/`)
- `AngularElementData`: Core data structure for components/directives/pipes
- `ProcessedTsConfig`: TypeScript configuration with path mappings
- `ProjectContext`: Project-specific context with indexer and config

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Detects Angular projects, loads/creates indexers
2. **Indexing**: Parses `.component.ts`, `.directive.ts`, `.pipe.ts` files
3. **Completion**: Provides suggestions based on trie prefix matching
4. **Diagnostics**: Identifies unknown Angular elements in templates
5. **Quick Fixes**: Automatically adds imports and updates module declarations

### Key Design Patterns

- **Multi-project support**: Each workspace folder gets its own indexer
- **Incremental updates**: File watcher maintains index consistency
- **Fallback parsing**: Regex parsing when ts-morph fails
- **Module resolution**: Handles both standalone and NgModule-based components
- **Library indexing**: Supports external Angular libraries from node_modules

### Configuration

Settings are defined in `package.json` under `contributes.configuration`:
- `angular-auto-import.projectPath`: Override workspace folder detection
- `angular-auto-import.index.refreshInterval`: Periodic reindexing (minutes)
- `angular-auto-import.diagnostics.*`: Control diagnostic behavior

### Testing Framework

- Uses VS Code Extension Test Runner (`@vscode/test-cli`)
- Test fixtures in `src/test/fixtures/` for different project scenarios
- Mocha-based test suites in `src/test/suite/`

### Code Quality Tools

- **Biome**: Linting, formatting, and style enforcement
- **Knip**: Dead code elimination and dependency analysis  
- **TypeDoc**: API documentation generation
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling with VS Code-specific optimizations

### Extension Commands

Available VS Code commands for testing and debugging:
- `angular-auto-import.reindex`: Reindex Project(s) - forces complete re-scan
- `angular-auto-import.clearCache`: Clear Cache - resets all cached data
- `angular-auto-import.showLogs`: Show Logs - displays extension output channel
- `angular-auto-import.showPerformanceMetrics`: Show Performance Metrics

### Development Guidelines

**TypeScript & VS Code Extension Development Rules:**

You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in TypeScript, VS Code Extension Development. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

**Core Development Principles:**
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant
- Fully implement all requested functionality
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces
- Comments in english
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing
- TSDoc update in code in changes
- Use biome-ignore only in exceptional cases when there are no other options
- `pnpm run lint` after change required

**Coding Environment:**
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- VS Code APIs
- TypeScript

**Key Technical Principles:**
- Use TypeScript `strict: true` with ES2022 target and Node16 modules
- Prefer async/await for all I/O operations with proper try/catch error handling
- Push all `Disposable`s to `context.subscriptions` for proper cleanup
- Use VS Code's progress API (`withProgress`) for long-running operations
- Leverage ts-morph for TypeScript AST parsing and manipulation
- Cache parsed data in VS Code workspace state for performance
