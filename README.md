## Why Angular Auto-Import?

Angular Auto-Import transforms how you work with Angular templates by eliminating the tedious task of manually importing components, directives, and pipes. Just use the element in your template, and let the extension handle the rest.

### Key Highlights

- **Fix All Missing Imports** - Import all missing Angular elements in your file with one command
- **Go to Definition** - Navigate to any unimported element's source with a single click (Material Design, Angular CDK, any npm package)
- **Intelligent Quick Fixes** - Get instant import suggestions with enhanced accuracy and performance
- **Works with External Libraries** - Auto-import from any Angular library in your node_modules
- **Monorepo Ready** - Seamless support for Nx and multi-project workspaces 

## Features

### üöÄ Fix All Missing Imports

The most powerful feature - fix **all** missing imports in your file with a single command. No more going through each element one by one.

**How to use:**
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `Angular Auto Import: Fix all missing imports in current file`
3. All missing components, directives, and pipes are automatically imported

Perfect for:
- Cleaning up newly created templates
- Fixing imports after moving components between files
- Bulk importing elements from external libraries

### ‚ö° Enhanced Quick Fixes

Get intelligent, context-aware import suggestions with improved accuracy and performance.

**Key improvements:**
- **Faster detection** - Instant diagnostics for missing imports
- **Smarter suggestions** - Prioritizes local components over library imports
- **Better accuracy** - Correctly resolves standalone vs module-based components
- **Path alias support** - Uses your `tsconfig.json` path mappings (`@app/*`, `@shared/*`)

**How to use:**
1. Hover over any underlined Angular element
2. Click the lightbulb or press `Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.`
3. Select the appropriate import from the suggestions

### üîç Go to Definition for Unimported Elements

Navigate directly to the source of any unimported Angular component, directive, or pipe with a single click. This is especially powerful for external libraries like Angular Material.

**Key features:**
- **Works for external libraries** - Click on Material Design components, Angular CDK, and any other npm package to jump to their source
- **Accurate navigation** - Navigates to the actual component declaration, not just the entry point (e.g., `button.component.ts` instead of `public-api.ts`)
- **Multi-project support** - Works seamlessly across monorepos and projects with re-exported components
- **No import required** - Explore library source without importing first

**How to use:**
1. Hover over any unimported Angular element in your template
2. `Ctrl+Click` (or `Cmd+Click` on Mac) or press `F12`
3. Jump directly to the component's source file

**Example:**
```html
<!-- No import needed - just Ctrl+Click to see the source -->
<button mat-raised-button>Click Me</button>
```

### Additional Features

- **üí° Smart Completions** - IntelliSense for Angular elements as you type in templates
- **üì¶ External Library Support** - Auto-import from any Angular package in node_modules
- **üè¢ Monorepo Support** - Works seamlessly with Nx and multi-project workspaces
- **üéØ Standalone Component Support** - Full support for both standalone and NgModule-based architecture
- **üîß Configurable Diagnostics** - Control severity levels and diagnostic modes

## Quick Start

1. **Install** the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=baryshevrs.angular-auto-import)
2. **Open** any Angular project (standalone components required)
3. **Use** any component, directive, or pipe in your template
4. **Let the extension** handle the imports automatically

That's it! The extension activates automatically when you open an Angular project.

## Installation

### From VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X` to open Extensions view
3. Search for `Angular Auto Import`
4. Click **Install**

### From Marketplace

Visit the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=baryshevrs.angular-auto-import) and click **Install**.

## Usage

### Diagnostics for Unimported Elements

The extension highlights any unimported Angular elements in your templates with a diagnostic indicator (configurable severity - error, warning, or info):

```html
<!-- Diagnostic shown here -->
<button mat-raised-button>Click Me</button>
```

This diagnostic tells you:
- **What's missing** - The exact component, directive, or pipe name
- **Where it comes from** - The module or library providing it
- **How to fix it** - Quick Fix suggestions or direct navigation

**Diagnostic modes:**
- `full` (default) - Shows visible diagnostics with quick fix options
- `quickfix-only` - Shows quick fixes without visible squiggly lines
- `disabled` - Turn off all diagnostics

### Quick Fix for Single Import

When you see a diagnostic for an unimported element:

1. **Hover** over the element or place your cursor on it
2. **Press** `Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.` or click the lightbulb icon
3. **Select** the import suggestion (e.g., `Import ButtonComponent from '@angular/material/button'`)

The extension automatically:
- Adds the import statement to your TypeScript file
- Updates the component's `imports` array (for standalone components)

### Navigate to Definition

Explore source code without importing:

1. **Hover** over any unimported Angular element (you'll see the diagnostic)
2. **Press** `F12` or `Ctrl+Click` / `Cmd+Click`
3. Jump directly to the component's source file

Works perfectly for:
- Material Design components
- Angular CDK utilities
- Third-party Angular libraries
- Your own local components

### Fix All Missing Imports

For files with multiple missing imports:

1. **Open** the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. **Run** `Angular Auto Import: Fix all missing imports in current file`
3. **Done** - All missing imports are added automatically

### Auto-completion

Start typing an Angular element in your template:

- Type `<my-comp` ‚Üí Get component suggestions
- Type `[my-dir` ‚Üí Get directive suggestions
- Type `| myPipe` ‚Üí Get pipe suggestions

Press `Enter` to insert the element. The extension will automatically add the import if needed.
